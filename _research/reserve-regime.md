excerpt: |
    We develop a general equilibrium model to quantify the welfare costs of
    alternative reserve regimes. Banks in our model face stochastic deposit
    flows requiring settlement through reserves, creating a precautionary
    demand shaped by frictions in the over-the-counter interbank market. We
    establish a novel irrelevance theorem, providing conditions under which
    interbank frictions and reserve quantities have no welfare implications.
    With frictions, however, banks' liquidity management materially affects
    credit provision and welfare. Quantitatively, we find that increasing
    inflation to 10% while holding the real discount window rate constant
    generates welfare costs of 0.8% of consumption—comparable to Lucas (2000)
    despite our model excluding currency. The model reproduces the post-2008
    tripling of reserve holdings and predicts that raising the real return on
    reserves initially reduces output as reserves crowd out productive loans,
    with this effect reversing only after deposit demand becomes satiated. Our
    results demonstrate that the welfare implications of returning to scarce
    reserves depend critically on implementation details.
