title: "Friedman-Schwartz vs. Tobin: A Modern Reassessment of the Great Depression"
collection: research 
category: wp 
excerpt: |
    We revisit the Friedman-Schwartz vs. Tobin debate about the Federal Reserve's
    role in the Great Depression by using modern econometric and
    quantitative-modeling tools. We calibrate a general equilibrium model with
    a banking sector and an interbank market, building off Bianchi and Bigio
    (2022). Our model offers novel contributions to the literature through its
    banking-focused approach that interconnects money, credit, and output. This
    framework allows us to leverage aggregate banking data from the era, including
    interbank rates, to examine the Federal Reserve's policy pass-through into the
    aggregate economy. The model allows us to weigh the relative importance of
    various shocks affecting banks and the economy during the period. It is
    well-suited for conducting counterfactual analyses of policies proposed in
    Friedman and Schwartz's "A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960,"
    particularly an expansion of discount window lending, while accounting for the
    constraints imposed by the gold standard.
