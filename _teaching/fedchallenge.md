This advanced course examines how monetary policy operates in the United States
during the 21st century, with particular focus on revolutionary changes in
Federal Reserve policy. Students study theoretical models and historical events
from the 19th century through modern times, using Ben Bernanke's "21st Century
Monetary Policy" as a foundation. The second half emphasizes practical
application through group presentations modeled after the college Fed
Challenge, where students analyze current economic conditions, forecast key
variables, identify risks, and develop policy recommendations for the Federal
Reserve. The course develops both analytical and communication skills essential
for economics careers.
