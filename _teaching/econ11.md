This course provides a rigorous introduction to the fundamental tools of
microeconomics. The first half focuses on consumer choice theory and
demand-side economics, including utility maximization, expenditure
minimization, and income and substitution effects. The second half develops
supply-side economics through production functions, cost minimization, and
profit maximization, culminating in both partial and general equilibrium
analysis. Students learn to approach economic questions analytically and build
the technical foundation necessary for advanced work in economics.
