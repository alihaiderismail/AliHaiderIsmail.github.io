This course introduces core concepts in macroeconomic theory and their
real-world applications. Topics include business cycles, economic growth
(including the Solow growth model), inflation, unemployment, and monetary
policy. The first half covers long-run growth models and classical economic
theory, while the second half explores Keynesian economics through the IS-LM
and IS-MP-PC models, international macroeconomics, and modern approaches to
monetary policy. The course includes an Excel assignment to deepen
understanding of key models and emphasizes connecting theoretical frameworks to
current economic events.
