<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p>My primary goal as an educator is to teach students how to think like
economists—not just to memorize models, but to build intuition and develop the
critical thinking skills needed to apply economic reasoning to real-world
complexity. The classroom models we study are deliberately simplified, and I
emphasize that we should not treat them as the final word. Instead, they serve as a
foundation for understanding the messy, multifaceted problems students will
encounter in their lives and careers. I want students to leave my courses
equipped to push beyond textbook examples, to recognize when assumptions break
down, and to adapt their analytical toolkit to new situations.</p>

<p>To achieve this, I design my teaching assistant sections around active learning. I believe that
learning is fundamentally an active task—students learn by doing, not just by
listening. In my sections, I regularly call on students during class, ask them
to work through problems in real time, and create opportunities for them to
practice recall and articulation. This approach can feel uncomfortable at
first, and I acknowledge that openly. I tell students that learning to say "I
don't know" is a crucial skill that keeps us on the side of expertise rather
than charlatanism. The discomfort of being called on is far outweighed by the
benefits: practicing recall strengthens memory, verbalizing ideas clarifies
thinking, and engaging actively with material makes it stick.</p>

<p>I also bring economic concepts to life by connecting them to current events and
issues students care about. I use additional readings from news sources and ask
students to find and discuss their own examples, helping them see that the
tools we're developing in class have immediate relevance. This dual focus—on
rigorous analytical thinking and practical application—ensures that students
do not just learn economics, but learn to use economics to make sense of the
world around them.</p>
